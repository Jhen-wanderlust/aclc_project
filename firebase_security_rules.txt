Authentication

1. Securing app is identifying users. This process is called authentication.
User identity is an important security concept. Different users have different data, and sometimes they have different capabilities. 

Firebase Security Rules are the only safeguard blocking access for malicious users. 

All authenticated users

- to set access to any authenticated user while you're developing your app.

example: 

{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth.uid != null",
    ".write": "auth.uid != null"
  }
}


1. Realtime Database, create a data path that defines app's users 

Content-owner only access - super admin side 

These rules restrict access to the authenticated owner of the content only. The data is only readable and writable by one user, and the data path contains the user's ID.

{
  "rules": {
    "some_path": {
      "$uid": {
        // Allow only authenticated content owners access to their data
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
